# Work-Scheduler

## Description
This project involves using JavaScript, and JQuery to create a work scheduler from 9am-5pm. In each time block, the user can type messages and notes which will be stored via a save button to local storage. The agenda is also color coded: grey for past, red for present, green for future. Finally, the color changes relative to the present time. This process is completed with a for loop.
